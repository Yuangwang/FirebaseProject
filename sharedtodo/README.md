# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

//firebase notes
It is strange that web offline is not supported in RTDB since ios/android are both supported and ios/android/web offline are all supported in firestore
Overall very easy to use RTDB
Small improvement to RTDB docs - could explain the reference (ref) similar to how storage explains it too
Would be nice for storage to have a live updated console without the need to refresh
Firestore are formatted very differently from RTDB, feels a bit strange
Firebase cloud storage pricing is a little ambiguous, hard to tell where the cutoff is for what a download is based on docs (does listing the items count? does using the exists function count? does a failed download count?)
Firebase storage could use a clean way to only download if exist, current iteration adds 404 into the console
When using two firebase products at once, its easy to accidently have functions names collide eg. ref from RTDB and cloud storage, might be helpful to note this as it is easy to miss
